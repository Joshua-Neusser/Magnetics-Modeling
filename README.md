# Magnetics-Modeling

This repository provides a collection of models for magnetic components, such as inductors and transformers. The models address crucial design aspects, including:

- Leakage inductance
- Core losses
- Winding (copper) Losses
- Thermal behavior

Each model comes with a detailed explanation of its function, usage, and limitations, making it easy to implement in power electronics and related projects.
